# Climate-Biodiversity Prediction System

## What's this all about?
I'm building this project to practice my R and Python data science skills while working on something I actually care about - climate change and biodiversity. This is a learning journey where I'm trying to analyze how climate change might affect biodiversity by mashing up different environmental datasets and playing with ML models.

**FAIR WARNING:** This is a personal learning project by a student (me!), not a professional tool. It might never be finished as I'm working on it between classes and other commitments. Consider it a playground for experimenting with environmental data science techniques!

## If you want to try it yourself
1. Clone this repo
2. Install Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install R packages: `Rscript src/r/install_packages.R`
4. Set up the database: `python src/python/init_database.py`
5. Have fun exploring!

## What's in here
- `data/`: Where all the climate and biodiversity data lives + DuckDB database
- `src/`: All my Python and R code
- `notebooks/`: Messy Jupyter notebooks where the real exploration happens
- `app/`: Shiny app code (if I get that far!)
- `models/`: ML models I'm experimenting with
- `docs/`: Notes to myself about what I'm learning

## Tech stack I'm learning
- Python & R (trying to practice both!)
- DuckDB for data storage (SQL practice without the headache)
- Machine Learning stuff: scikit-learn, tidymodels
- Visualization: Trying to make pretty charts with Shiny, matplotlib, ggplot2

## Goals
- Learn how to work with environmental datasets
- Practice both Python and R in the same project
- Get better at SQL through DuckDB
- Try different ML algorithms and see what works
- Maybe finish this someday, but no promises 

## Feedback
If you're a real data scientist and have suggestions, please be gentle - I'm still learning!
